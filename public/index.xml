      <title>Tapestry Lawns</title>

      <description>Tapestry lawns are grass-free lawns. By excluding grasses, other suitable plant can be used to produce an alternative to conventional monoculture turf lawns. Tapestry lawns produce more flowers, contain more life, and attract many pollinators. They require little mowing, absorb rain and need no fertilisers. Grass-free tapestry lawns use specific mowing tolerant plants instead of grass. They provide a source of nectar and pollen for more species of pollinators than grass lawns and commercial ‘flower lawns’.</description>

      <title>Mycorrhizal Fungi</title>

      <description>Mycorrhizas are the fungal associations that form between plant roots and beneficial fungi in the soil. They enable plants to obtain nutrients through a bi-directional exchange—carbon from plant to the fungus, and soil nutrients, mainly phosporous and nitrogen, from the fungus to plant. Mushrooms are only the fruiting bodies of fungi: beneath the surface is a vast mycelial network. The term mycorrhizal comes from the Greek words mykes, meaning fungus, and rhiza, meaning root.</description>
